Web-dev in progress

I am currently progressing on the front end developer track with scrimba! I am also fumbling my way through figuring out how GitHub and GitHub pages work.

I have to say that despite all of the negative aspects of the pandemic, I am very grateful to be getting back to web developent. It almost seems like I am coming full circle, coming back to a place I have not been in years to continue learning. And in the meantime it the world of web development, and all of the resources have grown exponentially. 

So lots to learn, but toools have gotten so much better and I feel like I getting my sea legs back. Its not exactly like riding a bike, becuase a lot has changed. But it is like getting back on board a ship, bound for new places. So grateful to be aboard!
